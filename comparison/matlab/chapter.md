# Comparison with MATLAB codes

This section contains micro-benchmarks for functions for which equivalent functionality is available in MATLAB codes provided
by corresponding researchers. We only provide micro-benchmarks for our implementation in `CR-Sparse` here. Benchmarking
for corresponding MATLAB code was done separately.
